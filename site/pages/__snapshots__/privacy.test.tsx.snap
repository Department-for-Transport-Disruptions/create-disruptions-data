        Who we are
      </h2>
      <p

      >
        The Create Transport Disruption Data Service allows users to convert their disruptions information into a format called SIRI-SX, which is an XML-based data standard. The service provides an easy-to-use webflow that takes the user through a series of questions, allowing them to define their disruptions. In order to make the process as simple as possible, we utilise data from Traveline National Dataset (TNDS), NaPTAN dataset and National Operator Code (NOC) database to represent bus operator routes and services to the user. The aim of the tool is to integrate closely with the Bus Open Data Service (BODS) in the publication of disruptions data.
